Design and generate a fully responsive, aesthetic, scroll-based romantic microsite intended as a love confession from a boy to a girl. The goal is to create an emotional, cinematic digital experience that feels like a love letter told through poetry, visuals, and soft animation.

The tone should be sincere, gentle, and timeless — not childish or gimmicky. Every section should feel intentional, beautiful, and mobile-first.
